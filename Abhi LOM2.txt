I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering in 2023 and have since been working as an Associate Software Developer in a reputed multinational corporation. My experience has been primarily focused on banking clients, where I have gained valuable insights into data-driven decision-making and business optimization.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a strong passion for leveraging data in business analysis to drive meaningful insights. The ability to interpret, analyze, and utilize data to optimize business strategies excites me. While working in the corporate sector, I was trained in Power BI, which enhanced my ability to visualize and interpret complex datasets. This experience has reinforced my desire to further deepen my expertise in data science and business intelligence to bridge the gap between raw data and business decision-making.

My role as an Associate Developer has allowed me to work with large datasets and banking-related applications, where I was exposed to various analytical techniques and data processing methods. During my tenure, I realized the importance of data-driven solutions in identifying inefficiencies and optimizing business performance. My hands-on experience with tools like Power BI and my ability to analyze business trends have motivated me to advance my knowledge in this field. I am confident that pursuing this MSc will refine my technical and analytical skills, preparing me for a future where data is central to business strategy.
